# Blacklist-Checker

### Description

Automation program I developed while working as a truck driver recruiter instead of doing any actual work.
 
The latest version (google_sheets_blacklist_checker.py) takes a .xlsx file containing phone numbers and compares it against the latest version of Blacklist which it pulls from the Google Sheets.
 
All blacklisted numbers are thrown away, and a clean downloadable list of phone numbers is produced.
